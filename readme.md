* This is part of my practice of exercises provided by the book _Agile Technical Practices Distilled_

Write a function to convert Arabic numbers to Roman numerals as good as you can, following the TDD practices we have
been using.

Given a positive integer number (for example, 42) determine its Roman numeral representation as a string (for example,
XLII). You cannot write numerals like IM for 999

Examples of Roman numerals by cyber-dojo are as follows:

| Arabic | Roman    | Arabic | Roman   |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1      | I        | 60     | LX      |
| 2      | II       | 70     | LXX     |
| 3      | III      | 80     | LXXX    |
| 4      | IV       | 90     | XC      |
| 5      | V        | 100    | C       |
| 6      | VI       | 200    | CC      |
| 7      | VII      | 300    | CCC     |
